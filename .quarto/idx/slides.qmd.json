Not every project can be perfectly reproducible in every way. You still have to do your job, meet deadlines.

Now I realize that in pretty much every case where I'm wondering this, I should start a new project. More on this later, but it's better to have many well-organized, lean projects than fewer bloated projects, in my opinion. And if you start with a project structure, then begin writing your script, you're in a better position than if you start with a script and then later realize you need this to be a project.\n\nInstead of justifying when to start a project, justify when NOT to. Make projects your default.\n\nNow that we have the project container, we'll talk about what goes on inside.\n:::\n\n## Parts of an analysis: Files\n\n::: {.r-fit-text}\n[source data, final data, intermediate data, <br />\nother helpful data,]{.txt-green} [analysis/processing scripts, <br />\ndata viz script, custom function scripts, <br />\nscript to load additional data,]{.txt-blue} [CSV output, <br />\nExcel output, HTML/XML/JSON output, plots, <br />\ntables, maps, reports,]{.txt-red} [Rhistory, RData]{.txt-yellow}\n:::\n\n## File organization {.smaller}\n\n:::{.columns.center}\n::::{.column width=25%}\n::::\n::::{.column width=30%}\n```\n\n\nmy-project/\n|-- .Rhistory\n|-- analysis_script.R\n|-- compare_outputs.R\n|-- data.rds\n|-- data_processing_script.R\n|-- data1.rds\n|-- data2.rds\n|-- df.csv\n|-- df1.rds\n|-- df2.rds\n|-- exploration.R\n|-- notes.txt\n|-- old_script.R\n|-- original_script.R\n|-- process_source_data.R\n|-- report.Rmd\n|-- workspace.RData\n|-- workspace1.RData\n```\n::::\n::::{.column width=30%}\n```\n\n\nmy-project/\n|-- data/\n|   |-- 1-source/\n|   |   |-- data1.rds\n|   |   |-- data2.rds\n|   |-- 2-final/\n|       |-- data_final.rds\n|-- output/\n|   |-- plot1.png\n|   |-- table1.csv\n|   |-- table2.csv\n|-- scripts/\n    |-- 01_data_validation.Rmd\n    |-- 02_data_processing.Rmd\n    |-- 03_data_viz.Rmd\n```\n::::\n:::\n\n:::{.notes}\nWhat order to run scripts?

This could be your own project from a year ago, or it could be a colleague's project who just had to go on emergency leave.\n\nReproducibility isn't just about the technical parts of an analysis. It's also about making sure that another person, who may not have your exact skill set, can walk through the analysis and understand it well enough to run it.\n:::\n\n## Good project structure\n\n- Consistent and predictable across similar projects\n- Easily accommodates variation\n- As simple as possible\n\n## Project structure example\n\n:::{.columns}\n::::{.column width=15%}\n::::\n::::{.column width=25%}\n```\n\nmy-project/\n|\n|-- data/\n|   |-- 1-source/\n|   |-- 2-aux/\n|   |-- 3-final/\n|\n|-- output/\n|\n|\n|-- scripts/\n|\n|\n|-- my-project.Rproj\n```\n::::\n::::{.column width=50%}\n```\n\n\n\n\nsource data only (from outside the project)\nintermediate/auxiliary data (everything else)\nfinal data only (the end result(s) of the project)\n\nnon-native data products (for use outside of R)\n -

attached automatically\n    + Explicitly attached packages\n    + Custom packages\n- R (version)\n- Operating system\n\n## `sessionInfo()`\n\n`sessionInfo()` captures a snapshot of your session\n\n:::{.nonincremental}\n- R version\n- package versions\n- operating system\n- and more\n:::\n\n## `sessionInfo()`\n\n```{r}\nsessionInfo()\n```\n\n## `sessionInfo()`\n\nYou can print the output directly to a text file\n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\nsink(\"session_info.txt\")\nsessionInfo()\nsink()\n```\n\n::: aside\nStolen from <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reproducibility-in-r-programming/>\n:::\n\n## renv is your friendv\n\n- renv ensures that the packages used in your project are recorded\n- It can save a library of packages within your project\n- Or it can save a snapshot of the packages in a lockfile, from which you can recreate your project-specific package library\n\n## Set up renv\n\n`renv::init()`\n\n:::{.columns}\n::::{.column width=60%}\n:::::{.nonincremental}\n- Call within a project to start using renv\n- Creates a project-specific package library in renv/\n- Creates a lockfile (renv.lock) that records the project state including packages\n- Creates .Rprofile to make sure renv runs in all future sessions\n:::::\n::::\n::::{.column width=40%}\n![](images/renv1.png)\n::::\n:::\n\n## Update (or record) the project state\n\n`renv::snapshot()`\n\n:::{.nonincremental}\n- Call to update the lockfile if you change something, e.g., attach new packages\n- This can be done anytime after calling `renv::init()`\n- It can also be done without ever calling `renv::init()` (a lightweight option)\n:::\n\n## Restore a project state\n\n`renv::restore()`\n\n:::{.nonincremental}\n- Call to recreate/restore the project-specific library from a lockfile\n- Great when collaborating, e.g., over GitHub, or restoring an archived project\n- This will not restore the R version, just packages\n:::\n\n## More renv\n\n<!-- -

Create a table in R. Export the table to a spreadsheet in Excel. Make manual changes to the Excel document. Import the data back into R.\n2. Process some data in R. Run that data through an app or API outside of your RStudio project. Import the modified data back into R.\n\n## Parts of an analysis: Beyond R\n\nIncludes using:\n\n- APIs\n- Shiny apps\n- Other files and software\n- Or anything outside of R used to modify data\n\n## Handling irreproducibility\n\n- Some things have to happen outside of R!\n- Document with narrative what has happened to the data\n- Save the exported (unmodified) data and imported (modified) data separately\n\n# Do we have time?\n\n## Document custom functions\n\n- Keep custom functions in separate scripts and use `source()`\n- Use package names in function calls if not base R (`package::function()`)\n- Describe the function arguments, expected input and output\n- Comment within the function itself\n- Use roxygen2 style documentation\n\n## When is a project over?\n\n- Resist project bloat\n- Repeated analyses (monthly, quarterly, annually) should each be a new project\n- You can always make the final data of one project the source data of another\n\n## What did I miss?\n\n- Setting a seed for random number generation (see [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reproducibility-in-r-programming/))\n- I avoided talking about version control because that's its own huge topic... tl;dr it's a good idea\n- Tracking custom packages with renv\n\n# Questions/discussion\n\n## Resources\n\n:::{.nonincremental}\n- [R for Data Science: Workflow: scripts
